# INDEPENDENT-PROJECT-18-UNSUPERVISED-LEARNING-IN-R

This is a project done in the 18th week of the Moringa School Data Science curriculum.

The files presented include workings on Unsupervised learning. Under the Unsupervised learning, Dimensionality reduction, Feature selection, Association rules and Anomaly detection methods were covered.

Part 1 and 2 of the work involves filtering out only relevant columns from a dataset using t - SNE algorithm and using feature selection. Part 3 involves using arules library to generate a model that pairs items to be bought in a supermarket according to how statistically relatable they are, while part 4 involves working on a fraud detection algorithm that works by detecting anomalies.
